# IOT_Fourth_Year
All work done on IOT in DT021A/4.

Assignment 1 (A1) 
Begins with using the Microbit's magnetometer/accelerometer and 
how to get readings printed to the terminal. Then using the Android application, the
direction/acceleration can be accessed via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) with the I2C 
protocol. I2C is used for this application as it allows for multiple slave devices.
The header files for the accompanying services are included in
accel_mag_ble2, 

Assignment 2 (A2) 
Includes the groundwork for a NodeJS application. Getting used 
to reading/writing files, making use of Node's asynchronous functions, event 
handling, and setting up a basic MQTT broker connection. Uding the Noble (think Node-BLE)
library allows Node and BLE to connect far easier, when the data is in the Node 
envirnonment it can be uploaded to the MQTT broker
